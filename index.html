Despite the worrying prevalence of mental health conditions, affected individuals and families continue to face the stigma associated with mental illness. This escalates isolation and the feeling of hopelessness, causing many people to deny or hide their condition from others.

The solitude of the mental illness journey causes many to suffer in silence, prompting affected individuals to seek self-medication and drug abuse.

        A majority of Kenyans make out-of-pocket payments to meet their healthcare expenses. In Kenya, healthcare spending pushes almost a million people into poverty every year.

Two out of every five Kenyans are unable to access healthcare when they need it because they cannot afford it.

Collaboration between the public and private sectors will bridge the gaps in healthcare access.

Healthcare stakeholders must prioritise the development of practical and affordable solutions that enable everyone to have access to quality mental healthcare.

Private health insurers, such as Jubilee Insurance, have already designed programmes that provide coverage for mental health services.
